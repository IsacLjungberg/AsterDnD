<h3>Philosophy and Morality</h3>
Selûnites believe in acceptance of all without prejudice, that everyone and everything can change given the right circumstances and motivations, and as an extension of this that everyone can be redeemed no matter how far they fall. Change is a core part of their philosophy, and is seen mostly in a positive light, as growth and remaking.
<br><br>
They tend to be somewhat critical of authority, and consider slavery to be among the greatest of evils.

<h4>Honesty and Illusion</h4>
Selûne is something of a trickster god, and her followers do not believe in total and radical honesty as other deities might. She is a goddess of illusion and shapechanging among many other domains, although she also grants her followers great powers of divination and revelation, among them the power to strip away false shapes. One might say thatwhat the moon maiden gives she can just as well take away.

<h3>Powers and Blessings</h3>
<h4>Shapechanging</h4>
Selûne grants powers of transformation, such as empowered wildshaping, shapeshifting, etc.

<h4>Revelation</h4>
In stark contrast to her gifts of transformation, Selûne also grants the power to force creatures back to their true forms and dispel or see through illusions. Such abilities come in the form of spells like <i>Moonbeam</i> or <i>True Seeing</i>
