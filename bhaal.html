<h3>Philosophy and Morality</h3>
Few worshipped Bhaal directly, though all acts of murder and violence could nourish him. Those who did follow the dark god where violent and cruel, with no regard for the sanctity of life, regularly committing murder for their own gain or just for the fun of it. The small cults of Bhaal that could be found believed that those most capable of violence should rule, and organized themselves based on this principle.
<br><br>
While full worship of Bhaal was rare, prayers to him was more common, as some individuals, even decently good ones, would beseech him for aid when they had to spill blood.

<h3>Bhaalspawn</h3>
Many deities had a hand in the creation of mortals infused with their essence, but bhaal was particularly prolific in this regard, his divine offspring known as the bhaalspawn. Such individuals were granted a variety of dark powers, but most their most defining trait was an overwhelming lust for carnage, a dark urge.
<br><br>
While bhaalspawn weren't inherently evil, few could overcome their urges and work towards good, and most succumbed to them in one way or another.
