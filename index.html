<h1>Realms of Aster</h1>
Greetings traveler! <br>
And welcome to a world of many worlds, stocked with adventure and perils galore. A world I hope this compendium of a sort can help you make sense of and enjoy.
<br><br>
This page is a compendium describing my version of the D&D 5e multiverse, through lore and rules. This information should primarily be read as the writings of skilled sages and travelers, knowledgeable people to be sure, but far from infallible. For a given game or world, things might be different, in small or massive ways. This compendium also tends to generalize quite often, and may occasionally value flowery language over strict correctness. With all that known, welcome!

<h2>Cosmology</h2>
Planes, gods, magic, souls, planets, all of it interacts and interplays to form the vast tapestry that is creation.
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>[[Ethereal Plane]]: A plane of souls and spirits that runs parallel to the [[Prime Material Plane]].</li>
    <li>[[Prime Material Plane]]: In ways the centre of creation, a mix of all the components of creation, and home to most mundane non-magical mortals, but a massive variety beyond that.</li>
    <li>[[Outer Planes]]: The afterlives that await mortal creatures, locations shaped by mighty beings like [[Gods]] and archdevils, where physicality is a manifestation of morality and thought.</li>
    <li>[[Gods]]: The greatest of beings that rule over creation, their motivations many and often at odds.<div id = "listOfGods"></div></li>
    <li>[[Souls]]: Identity exists beyond the mere flesh of mortal creatures, their memories and personality stored in the form of a soul.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>[[Soulflesh]]: The physical manifestation of souls of which most beings of the [[Outer Planes]] are made.</li>
            <li>[[Soul Coin]]</li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Economy</h2>
Money makes the world go 'round, as they say. Or rather more generally, the productions and exchanging of goods and services, often with money as a sort of proxy for real value, i.e. the economy, makes the world go 'round.
<br><br>
Economies come in countless different varieties, with a huge amount of variation, but in the general case certain things are true. In most worlds, copper, silver and gold are the main measures of value, and they will often have related currencies that remain fairly similar across different locations. Either way we can generally talk about value in terms of these currencies, to have a standard unit of measurement, since they remain fairly standardized.
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>[[Expected Adventurer Income]]: Adventurer income can vary tremendously, but there are still general trends useful as guidelines.<ul>
        <li>[[Loot Tables]]</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>[[Wealth Classes]]: In general, society can be divided into categories of people based on income, described here.</li>
    <li>[[Soul Coin]]</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>[[Dark One's Oath]]<ul>
        <li>[[Dead One's Oath]]</li>
    </ul></li>
