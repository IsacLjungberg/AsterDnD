<h1>Necrigal</h1>
An obscure and feared god of undeath, that manifests its power through dark forests filled with necromantic power, and opposes most all other gods, but most of all [[Selûne]].

<ul>
    <li>Domains: Necromancy, death, undead, liches</li>
    <li>Titles: Lord of Death (Döttsherren), Death's Root (Dödens Rot / Döttsroten), the Darkwood Lord (Mörkskogs Fursten)</li>
    <li>Symbol: A withered dark tree with black leaves</li>
    <li>Followers: <ul>
        <li>Denonym: Necrinite</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Necrinite Forests</h3>
Special geographical features created by the Darkwood lord and its followers, these are forests filled with plants that are half alive and half dead, the most characteristic being trees of dark gray wood with black leaves. Such regions have several notable properties that generally apply:
<ul>
    <li>Necrinite wood: The dark gray wood that composes most of the trees in a necrinite forests is infused with necrotic magic, which is retained even when the wood is removed from said forest. Touching it with bare skin deals light necrotic damage, as does being pierced or stabbed with it. Having it inserted into one's body for an extended period is much worse, as it deals not only necrotic but also psychic damage, as the darkwood lords voice begins to overwhelm the afflicted.
    <br>
    When this wood comes into contact with recently dead creatures, it raises them up as weak undead. A creature killed by inserting it into them will often be raised as a stronger creature, sometimes with part of their memories and personality intact.
    <br>
    The wood is also a useful material in various necromantic rituals.
    <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Soul trap: Creatures that die in a necrinite forest and become undead due to its magic are trapped there and cannot leave by their own free will without magical aid, with the exception of some undead blessed by necrigal.<br>
    This extends into border regions of the [[Ethereal Plane]], and as a result these forests are filled with trapped and restless spirits, though most cannot directly influence the material plane.<br><br></li>
    <li>Spontaneous undeath: The necrotic magic of a necrinite forest causes decently fresh (and sometimes even very old) corpses to spontaneously rise as undead creatures.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Philosophy and Beliefs</h3>
A core part of Necrinite beliefs centers around the idea that the afterlife that other faiths consider to be true is a lie. Necrinites see other gods as eldritch monstrosities that deceive their followers and then devour their souls when they die, and most do all they can to avoid this fate.
<br><br>
They do this by clinging to life, or unlife, no matter what, and when they cannot do this they prefer to die in necrinite forests, where they may not be as they once where, but at least they won't move on to the afterlife as their spirits will be trapped.

<h3>Blessings and Powers</h3>
Necrigal grants its followers many powers, such as the power to drain life energy, raise and control undead, or even return as undead creatures themselves.

<h4>Darkwood Blessing</h4>
<i>Boon, Uncommon</i><br>
A blessing in the form of a splinter of necrinite wood inserted into a creature, normally below the left shoulderblade. Normally such a thing would cause a slow painful death, but through Necrigals divine favour the splinter is rendered inert until the creature with the blessing dies. At that point, the splinter awakens and begins growing roots through the creature's body. 1 hour later, the creature is raised as an undead, with its soul, memories, and abilities intact.
<br><br>
This can be prevented by pouring holy water on the body, or using some other form of magic that prevents undeath. A creature can also attempt to remove the splinter by searching through the corpse with a DC 20 investigation check. If the splinter is removed the blessing is as well. Destroying the body to a sufficient extent, such as by removing the head, also prevents it.
<br><br>
Undead can receive this blessing, though once used the blessing is depleted it must be received anew.
