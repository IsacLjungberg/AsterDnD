<h1>Souls</h1>
It is plain to see throughout the realms that there is something to personhood, to identity, memory and personality, beyond mere flesh. Something that lives on when the flesh fails, that can be called back to grant new life. An immortal, or rather just hard to destroy, soul.

<h3>What is soul and what is flesh</h3>
Much debate can be had about what parts of an individual are the result of the makeup of their physical forms, especially of their brains, and what is given rise to by their underlying soul. Full consensus has yet to be reached among scholars, but some things are known.
<br><br>
The soul holds memories, and at major part of personality and capability, but not all of it. A soul resurrected into a different body from its original will for most intents and purposes be the same person, with the same memories. But they may find their personalities altered due to their new forms, and while they might retain their knowledge, their ability to recall and not lose that knowledge, and their ability to make effective use of it, as well as their general mental acuity, may very well be influenced by their new form.

<h2>Bodyless souls and the ethereal</h2>
A soul cannot fully exist without a body on the <a href="primeMaterial.html">Prime Material Plane</a>. Instead they exist in a part of the <a href="etherealPlane.html">Ethereal Plane</a> known as the border ethereal. Most exist there and are unable to interact in any way with the material, but some, especially those who fail to move on to the afterlife, can gain the power to partially cross over an affect it.

<h2>Death and the afterlife</h2>
Death is not the end, and in the normal case, when a creature dies, it, or rather it's soul, will begin a journey from the border ethereal into the deep ethereal, and finally to its eventual afterlife among the <a href="outerPlanes.html">Outer Planes</a>. This is a journey few can take alone, and thus it is the role of psychopomps, entities of the outer planes, to guide a soul along its journey and allow them into their afterlife.
<br><br>
In a sense this is judgement, because psychopomps and the afterlives they represent may or may not choose to take a soul. They can only take so many, and taking those who did not follow the associated teachings and morals may lead to chaos and fracturing. Many factors increase the likelyhood of a soul being picked up, like proper adherence to the morals of a particular deity, but also proper funerary rights, which are in a way a method of summoning psychopomps.
<br><br>
Existence as a bodyless spirit is a painful one, and most creatures become desperate enough to escape it. Desperate enough to make deals with the devils of the <a href="nineHells.html">Nine Hells</a>. Others simply wander until their nature or bad luck pulls them into a less than pleasent plane, like the hells or the <a href="abyss.html">Abyss</a>. Creatures can also end up in such places by making deals with devils in life, or simply being stolen either living or dead by a demon.
