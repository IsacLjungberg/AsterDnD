<h1>Prime Material Plane</h1>
The arguable centre of creation, where all the forces of the planes beyond mix together. This is the realm of mortals, a vast variety of creatures and entities, and most adventures to be had.

<h2>Structure and Spelljamming</h2>
The planets that most creatures call home are massive bodies floating through the prime, existing in so called <b>wildspace systems</b>, where they orbit one another and most often a central sun at the heart of a system. Their movements are decided by powerful magic and forces few have ever come to fully comprehend. These spaces are airless voids, though they are rarely empty of life.
<br><br>
Beyond the wildspace systems is the astral sea, a strange transitive plane, different from the prime but still part of it, and quite close to the <a href="outerPlanes.html">Outer Planes</a> in a planar sense. More details about it can be found later in this document.

<h3>Air Envelopes</h3>
Any object that is decently massive generates its own Air Envelope, this being an ellipsoidal "bubble" that keeps gas trapped within it. On a decently massive ship this means breathing creatures usually don't need to worry about running out of oxygen, but notably the envelope doesn't create breathable air, it just keeps it in. When two air envelopes overlap they become one, and the gasses within quickly mix and reach an equilibrium.

<h3>Spelljammers</h3>
Vessels steered by the power of a magical spelljamming helm, or an equivelent object or force, spelljammers traverse wild space systems and the silvery void of the astral sea. They can travel at incredible speeds through empty space, but slow down to normal flying speed, within the realm of how fast normal naval craft and creatures tend to move, when near massive objects.
<br><br>
The vast majority of spelljammers also hold relatively simple magic which imposes gravity, most often in a single "downward" direction, within their air envelopes. Some might use other configurations, like having two opposing directions of gravity on both halves of the envelope, or having a single point of gravity at their centre (mimicing the natural behavior of very large bodies).

<h3>Movement and weightlessness</h3>
Entities and objects capable of movement by magical means, just as spelljammers or creatures using the fly spell, can move around as usual in wildspace while not affected by gravity. Creatures that rely on an atmosphere to fly, such as those using mundane wings, cannot control their path in wildspace using such means when they aren't inside a larger air envelope.
<br><br>
Within a larger envelope but without gravity, a creature capable of flight is able to fly as normal. A creature that is able to swim can move similarly, though they move at half the speed they would in a proper liquid medium. As a result, most creatures can propel themselves, though quite slowly, while weightless.

<h3>The Astral Sea</h3>
Beyond individual wildspace systems lies the transitive plane known as the astral sea. This is physically speaking a part of the prime material plane since one can travel to it by mundane means, but it is very different from the rest of the prime in many notable ways.

<h4>Movement in the Astral</h4>
Entities and objects able to move unassisted without gravity in wildspace can do so in the same way in the astral, and in addition a creature that is weightless can move as if it was part of a larger air envelope anywhere in the astral.
<br><br>
But there is an additional type of motion unique to the astral, that being movement by thought. Creatures are able to propel themselves by willing themselves to move in a direction, at a speed of 3 times their intelligence score.

<h4>Timeless Domain</h4>
Time does not pass normally in the astral sea. Most biological processes are halted, and as a result creatures don't need to eat, sleep, or breathe, and they don't age.

<h4>Air</h4>
The astral sea seems to be filled with perfectly breathable normal air, although it is hard to know if it is truly filled with it or if some strange property makes it seem that way, especially since creatures there don't need to breathe either way.

<h4>Travel in the Astral</h4>
Travel works similarly in the astral and the material, though it is more reliant on intent in the astral. A creature wills itself or its craft to go to a nearby location, and it moves in the right direction. Although it often takes experience and intelligence to find a fast and safe path through this method, and most who are very good at it also tend to display psionic abilities.

<h3>The Far Realm and Aberrations</h3>
Some scholars and adventurers might mistakenly believe the far realm to be a single location or plane which one can travel to, but this is patently false. In actuality, the far realm is simply a collective term for all the strange and incomprehensible locations that exist at impossible distances from what creatures are familiar with. Alien worlds home to unknown horrors, which one might have to travel for years or centuries to reach.
<br><br>
The term for creatures that inhabit it, <a href="aberration.html">Aberration</a>, is likewise just a general term for creatures that don't fit into the common understanding of reality. As such, two different aberrations might be vastly different from one another, but they will be brought together by the fact that they are utterly alien to the creatures that would call them aberrations.
