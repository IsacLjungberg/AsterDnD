<h1>Aberration</h1>
Arguably the strangest creature class that exists, aberration is simply a collective term for all creatures that are so alien that they don't fit into any other category. Because of this simple definition, two aberrations can vary immensely, only similar in that they are different from what most would considered normal.

Because of this very general definition, it is impossible to describe all aberrations using any shared traits, but in general, one can still classify them by their origins, which come in two broad categories.
<ul>
    <li>Distant: The most common category, aberrations of distant origins are alien simply because they began somewhere very far away, in a part of the <a href="primeMaterial">Prime Material</a>, or some stranger place still, that can't really be reached by normal means and that remains uncontacted.</li>
    <li>Ancient: Less common are the aberrations that don't originate in a far away place but rather a long passed time, and are alien simply because they are nigh incomprehensibly old.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Alien Intelligence</h3>
Many aberrations are intelligent creatures, but most often their intelligence is far different from that of normal humanoids. The following are some ways that this significant difference in thinking can manifest.

<ul>
    <li>Unaware of Dishonesty: To some aberrant minds, particularly those who communicate in a psychic manner through pure thought, communication might exclusively be a means of sharing factual information. Such creatures may not have any concept of information being shared that is not strictly factual. They can likely understand information that is wrong, but not information that has no intention of being right.<br>
    As such they will assume all statements are true, likely only being confused and assuming a creature that lied to them to have been mistaken when the lie is revealed, and additionally they do not consume or understand fiction, taking all statements at face value.</li>
    <li>Unaware of Emotion: Some aberrant minds might be fully and strictly rational, only driven towards their goals, with no other complex emotions or motivations. They might also not at all understand emotional tendencies in other creatures, unable to read emotions or even comprehend the idea that a creature might act in a way that isn't in strict accordance with some well defined goal.</li>
    <li>Unaware of Morality: Some aberrant minds might have moral beliefs that are utterly incomprehensible to other creatures, or they might not have a grasp of morality at all.</li>
    <li>No Individuality: Hive minded creatures may have no concept of individuality, and likely won't understand a creature's desire to survive on its own beyond the desire to preserve its kind.</li>
</ul>
