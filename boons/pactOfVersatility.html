<h1>Pact of Versatility</h1>
<i>Boon, very rare</i><br>
A myriad of options are laid out before you: Fractions of the power of a pure warlock, but without costing you the power you've already gathered.
<br><br>
You gain one of the pact options of the warlock class, and one eldritch invocations, of your choice.<br>
For instance, you may take pact of the chain and voice of the chain master, to gain a special familiar that you can communicate with at any range and even have speak with your own voice, to use as a potent spy or messenger. Or you may take pact of the tome and book of ancient secrets, you gain a tome into which you can scribe down ritual spells belonging to any class.
<br><br>
<i>Devils play a long game, and as such they are very willing to offer powerful mortals enticing boons, in exchange for the simply ownership of their souls. Especially tempting since such a deal won't do any harm in the immediate future, unless further payment is specified. But once the mortal does die, as all mortals eventually will, no matter the circumstances of such a death, or if the mortal hopes to be resurrected, their debt comes due, and for most it wasn't quite worth it in the end.</i>
