<h1>Potion of Heroism</h1>
<i>Potion, Uncommon (150gp)</i><br>
This viscous opaque potion looks almost like molten gold, and has a heavenly sweet taste. A creature that consumes this potion gains 10 temporary hit points, and can add a d4 to any attack rolls, saving throws, or ability checks they make. Both this bonus and any remaining temporary hitpoints granted by this spell are lost after 24 hours.
