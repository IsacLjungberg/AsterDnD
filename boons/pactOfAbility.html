<h1>Pact of Ability</h1>
<i>Pact, very rare</i><br>
You are granted greater potency in an area of your choice, a tempting deal for most. You can improve two ability scores by 1, 1 by two, or take a feat of your choice. In addition, if this boon improves any of your ability scores, either directly or via a feat, the limit of how high you can improve that score via ASIs and feats also increases by an equal amount.
<br><br>
<i>Devils play a long game, and as such they are very willing to offer powerful mortals enticing boons, in exchange for the simply ownership of their souls. Especially tempting since such a deal won't do any harm in the immediate future, unless further payment is specified. But once the mortal does die, as all mortals eventually will, no matter the circumstances of such a death, or if the mortal hopes to be resurrected, their debt comes due, and for most it wasn't quite worth it in the end.</i>
