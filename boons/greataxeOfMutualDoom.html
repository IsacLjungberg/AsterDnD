<h1>Greataxe of Mutual Doom</h1>
<i>Greataxe, uncommon</i><br>
This greataxe, made of a single fused piece of dark jagged metal, is imbued with necrotic power, dangerous to both wielder and target. When a creature hits a target with an attack using the axe, they may choose to unleash this power. The target of the attack takes 1d12 necrotic damage, in addition to the normal damage the attack would deal, but the wielder takes the same amount of damage.
<br><br>
Even on a critical hit, the target and wielder still suffers the same amount of additional necrotic damage.
<br><br>
The damage caused by this weapon to the wielder can be reduced by effects that would reduce necrotic damage taken as normal.
