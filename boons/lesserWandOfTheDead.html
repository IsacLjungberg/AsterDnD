<h1>Lesser Wand of the Dead</h1>
This wand is made of dark gray wood with a sharp point, and a pommel carved into the visage of a skull. It can be wielded as a dagger, and in the hands of an attuned creature, it deals an additional 1 necrotic damage to its target.
<br><br>
The item can be used to cast either speak with dead or animate dead. Once either spell is used, neither can be used again until an attuned creature finishes a long rest.
<br><br>
<i>These wands where forged by Zetherian wizards from necrinite wood, seeking to tame the power of the dark god [[Necrigal]], and in this case they succeeded. Many variations exist, some more potent than others.</i>
