<h1>Dark One's Oath</h1>
<i>Ring, rare (requires attunement by a creature with the paladin's "divine smite" feature)</i><br>
This ring, forged from dark metal and inscribed with infernal symbols, is granted to paladins by fiends to give them greater power, and also to prevent them from turning on those same fiends.
<br><br>
Whenever you smite will wearing and attuned to this ring, the additional damage of the smite is doubled but is dealt as fire damage rather than radiant damage. In addition, your smites no longer deal additional damage to fiends, but instead deals the same additional damage to celestials (the additional damage to undead is unaffected).<br><br>
<b><i>Curse of binding.</i></b> You must wear this item for the entire period of attuning to it. Once attuned, it attaches to your finger and cannot be removed by normal means. Casting remove curse on it ends your attunement to the ring and lets you take it of normally. Severing the finger on which you are wearing the ring also ends the attunement.
<br><br>
<b><i>Variant, Dead One's Oath.</i></b> Similar to the item forged by fiends is the one created by necromancers and undead. It works just the same, but radiant damage of the wearer's smites is replaced with necrotic damage instead, and rather than fiends it is undead that no longer take additional damage from your attacks. Celestials still take additional damage.
