<h1>Wealth Classes</h1>
There are a vast number of different professions and paths to income, but in general society can be divided into different classes based on how much individuals make. Such categories share much, including what they most often work with and what their lives are like.

<h2>The Classes</h2>
The different wealth classes, with descriptions, common professions, ranges and averages of income, etc.
<br><br>
Note that income means before expenses and tax, and that it is also an abstraction. A farmer likely isn't getting paid in coin mostly but rather runs a self sufficient household, only buying things rarely, but still produces goods and services that can be valued in gold.
<h3>Poor</h3>
Making up 40% of the population, the poor folk make between 6 and 30 gold pieces each month, with the average at around 10.<br>
The vast majority are non landowing farmers, but many young folks perhaps working for their family members and not yet fully independent, as well as unskilled laborers, certain street peddlers, petty criminals, and a variety of other folk, can also fall into this category.
<br><br>
They make just enough to get by without room for any kind of luxuries, likely don't have much in the way of savings, and when hard times come they are struck the worst.

<h3>Modest</h3>
Making up 40% of the population, modest folk make between 30 and 60 gold pieces each month, with the average at around 40.<br>
They might be common soldiers or guards, farmers who own their land, priests, etc.
<br><br>
They live relatively safe and comfortable lives, able to keep some savings and even afford the odd luxury on occasion, like a nice dress or a vacation. That said, they aren't much farther from disaster than the poor when bad things happen.

<h3>Comfortable</h3>
Making up 15% of the population, the comfortable folk make between 60 and 120 gold pieces each month, with the average at around 80.<br>
They might be merchants, low ranking but still important military officers, skilled tradespeople, etc.
<br><br>
They live safe and comfortable lives, able to keep large savings if so inclined and afford luxuries somewhat often. When hard times strike, they have the means to either pull through or go somewhere else without to much trouble or risk.

<h3>Wealthy</h3>
Making up 4% of the population, wealthy folk make between 120 and 300 gold pieces each month, with the average around 160. <br>
They might be highly succesful and skilled merchants or tradespeople, favoured servants of royalty, etc.
<br><br>
They may not live lives of security and luxury, though not at the tremendous levels of the true upper tiers of society.

<h3>Aristocratic</h3>
The top 1% of society, making more than 300 gp each month, with an average of 400. These are the nobles, mages, high military leaders, and generally highly affluent individuals.
<br><br>
They live lives of garish wealth and high security, if they so wish, though some may spend their wealth on other expensive projects.

<h2>Levels and CRs of the classes</h2>
It is possible to somewhat predict what kind of levels of characters one will find in a certain working position by how much gold they earn. This is a very rough estimate, subject to many different factors, but can be helpful. It is based on <a href="expectedAdventurerIncome.html">Expected Adventurer Income</a>. The following table shows how much characters of levels might expect to make depending on how dangerous their work is, per month.
<br><br>

<h3>Using the table</h3>
This table can be a good very rough guideline for how much a competitive wage for a character of a given level, i.e. a given competency, is. Of note is that many adventuring types won't live lives of the kind of wealth they have, because massive expenses are par for the course. They must maintain armor and weapons, they need to travel and stay in inns which is expensive, but most notably most will invest in <b>magical items</b>, which are outrageously expensive.
<br><br>
Notable individuals who might often be making more than the table suggests are utility mages who live safe lives, as their services are highly sought after in many regions. They may not have many customers, but those they can get are willing to pay a lot.
