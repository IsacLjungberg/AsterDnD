<h1>Wealth Classes</h1>
There are a vast number of different professions and paths to income, but in general society can be divided into different classes based on how much individuals make. Such categories share much, including what they most often work with and what their lives are like.

<h2>The Classes</h2>
The different wealth classes, with descriptions, common professions, ranges and averages of income, etc.
<br><br>
Note that income means before expenses and tax, and that it is also an abstraction. A farmer likely isn't getting paid in coin mostly but rather runs a self sufficient household, only buying things rarely, but still produces goods and services that can be valued in gold.
<h3>Poor</h3>
Making up 40% of the population, the poor folk make between 6 and 30 gold pieces each month, with the average at around 10.<br>
The vast majority are non landowing farmers, but many young folks perhaps working for their family members and not yet fully independent, as well as unskilled laborers, certain street peddlers, petty criminals, and a variety of other folk, can also fall into this category.
<br><br>
They make just enough to get by without room for any kind of luxuries, likely don't have much in the way of savings, and when hard times come they are struck the worst.

<h3>Modest</h3>
Making up 40% of the population, modest folk make between 30 and 60 gold pieces each month, with the average at around 40.<br>
They might be common soldiers or guards, farmers who own their land, priests, etc.
<br><br>
They live relatively safe and comfortable lives, able to keep some savings and even afford the odd luxury on occasion, like a nice dress or a vacation. That said, they aren't much farther from disaster than the poor when bad things happen.

<h3>Comfortable</h3>
Making up 15% of the population, the comfortable folk make between 60 and 120 gold pieces each month, with the average at around 80.<br>
They might be merchants, low ranking but still important military officers, skilled tradespeople, etc.
<br><br>
They live safe and comfortable lives, able to keep large savings if so inclined and afford luxuries somewhat often. When hard times strike, they have the means to either pull through or go somewhere else without to much trouble or risk.

<h3>Wealthy</h3>
Making up 4% of the population, wealthy folk make between 120 and 300 gold pieces each month, with the average around 160. <br>
They might be highly succesful and skilled merchants or tradespeople, favoured servants of royalty, etc.
<br><br>
They may not live lives of security and luxury, though not at the tremendous levels of the true upper tiers of society.
