<h1>Expected Adventurer Income</h1>
Adventurers are a core part of many worlds, and at the very least the heart of adventurers taking place in such worlds. These adventurers have extraordinary capabilities that place them far above the ordinary folk. And that will very often make them a lot of money.
<br><br>
The specific amount can vary tremendously, but the following chart describes a baseline for how much adventurers can expect to earn in the time it takes them to advance in power by a level, thus giving a rough approximation of how wealthy adventurers ought to be. This is less a rule and more a very soft guideline, mostly just to give an order of magnitude for the wealth of characters of a given level. The wealth described is the amount of gold a character will usually amass while being a certain level, i.e. between reaching the corresponding level from the previous, and leaving the level for the next. It does not describe what gold they will keep, only what they will earn.
<br><br>
The table also describes roughly what CR of creature is equivelent to what level of character. This is a very rough translation and is once again just a guideline. Its based on the idea that an encounter between a single character and a monster of their same power level should be a deadly encounter at minimum, since both parties should stand an equal chance of winning.<br>
It is worth noting that in this comparison entities built like player characters will punch above their weight, since the analysis assumes they can go all out and use their resources. Monsters tend not to have resources in the same way. As such an exhausted monster will fight the same as one that is fully rested, while a PC won't, in general.
