<h1>Expected Adventurer Income</h1>
Adventurers are a core part of many worlds, and at the very least the heart of adventurers taking place in such worlds. These adventurers have extraordinary capabilities that place them far above the ordinary folk. And that will very often make them a lot of money.
<br><br>
The specific amount can vary tremendously, but the following chart describes a baseline for how much adventurers can expect to earn in the time it takes them to advance in power by a level, thus giving a rough approximation of how wealthy adventurers ought to be. This is less a rule and more a very soft guideline, mostly just to give an order of magnitude for the wealth of characters of a given level. The wealth described is the amount of gold a character will usually amass while being a certain level, i.e. between reaching the corresponding level from the previous, and leaving the level for the next. It does not describe what gold they will keep, only what they will earn.
<br><br>
The table also describes roughly what CR of creature is equivelent to what level of character. This is a very rough translation and is once again just a guideline. Its based on the idea that an encounter between a single character and a monster of their same power level should be a deadly encounter at minimum, since both parties should stand an equal chance of winning.<br>
It is worth noting that in this comparison entities built like player characters will punch above their weight, since the analysis assumes they can go all out and use their resources. Monsters tend not to have resources in the same way. As such an exhausted monster will fight the same as one that is fully rested, while a PC won't, in general.

<h2>Common Exceptions</h2>
The table is a very rough general guideline, but many factors will influence how much money characters can actually make.<br>
One major factor is how <b>profit driven</b> a character is. A noble cleric who helps people out of kindness will likely only earn a fraction of the average in the table because they don't demand compensation for their services and only make money incidentaly. A profit driven mercenary on the other hand is likely to make an average amount.<br>
Characters with <b>utility abilities</b> also tend to be wealthier, since they have a fair amount of combat prowess, but also other abilities that can often be more in demand. This applies especially to certain spellcasters.<br>
Other factors influencing <b>profitability</b> will obviously also have an impact.<br>
In summmary, the table is an average and a guideline. An average mercenary or adventurer is likely to be making close to it.<br>
A noble hero who asks little for their services may be making less, although can often expect an equivelent in support from those aligned to their cause.<br>
Meanwhile a clever mage with utility based abilities that are very useful and in high demand is likely to be making far more.<br>
And a ruler who uses their abilities may possess wealth that dwarfs the average.

<h2>Per time income rather than per level</h2>
Player Characters in most games are exceptional in how fast they get stronger. They are prodigies, and on top of that they expose themselves to far greater danger than the average person would. Therefore it makes sense to consider their income in terms of gold per level.
<br><br>
For other people who don't level nearly as fast or at all, it doesn't. For them it makes more sense to consider income in terms of things done or time worked. In this endeavor the activities characters are usually taking can be divided into 4 categories based on how dangerous they are. The greater the danger, the faster they make money.

<h3>Extreme Adventuring</h3>
In extreme adventuring, a character survives by the skin of their teeth, if at all, and will likely be exhausting most of their resources on many occasions.<br>
On average they will make their full levels worth of gold in around 3 specific missions or periods of high action over the course of 1 week, but it can be much shorter if these missions are more compressed.

<h3>Dangerous Adventuring</h3>
Much safer than the tier above but still risky, in dangerous adventuring a character makes their full levels worth of gold over the course of two weeks of adventuring.

<h3>Unsafe Adventuring</h3>
Unsafe adventuring consists of tasks where danger might arise but isn't expected to, at least not often or in major ways. Guard work is a good example.<br>
Such characters make their full level's worth of gold in 4 weeks or a full month of "adventuring".

<h3>Safe Adventuring</h3>
Safe adventuring is primarily reserved for characters with utility abilities, like hired spellcasters or artisans. The work is largely fully devoid of risk unless extraordinary circumstances occur.<br>
These characters make their full level's worth of gold in 8 weeks or 2 months of "adventuring".
