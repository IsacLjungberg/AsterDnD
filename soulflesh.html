<h1>Soulflesh</h1>
Most beings of the <a href="outerPlanes.html">Outer Planes</a> are made out of a substance known as soulflesh, which is more or less what it sounds like. <a href="souls.html">Souls</a> manifested as physical form, spirit made flesh. When a body made out of such a material is damaged enough, the soul departs, and the soulflesh thus loses cohesion and begins rapidly disintigrating, leaving nothing behind.
<br><br>
It is noteworthy that soulflesh won't always appear as "flesh" in the traditional sense. This is most common by far, but it may also appear as stone, metal, or any other number of materials.
