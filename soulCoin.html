<h1>Soul Coin</h1>
<i>Wondrous item</i>
Among the worst fates that can be suffered by a soul, a Soul Coin is a large circular coin made of infernal iron, 5 centimeters in diamater and about a half centimeter thick, weighing 100 grams or about a fifth of a pound, inside which is sealed a <a href="souls.html">Soul</a>.
<br><br>
These coins are a primary currency in certain outer planes, but especially the <a href="nineHells.html">Nine Hells</a> where they are also mainly manufactured. While different souls can hold different levels of value, soul coins are usually made out of the lowest among souls and thus have a roughly standard value outside of special circumstances. The standard price of a soul coin is 100 gp.

<b><i>Existence as a soul coin.</i></b> The soul in a soul coin is constantly half conscious, trapped and utterly deprived of any sensation, usually in a state of despairy. This is a horrific fate, though not utterly maddening as the soul isn't fully conscious without a proper physical form. Souls later freed who have spent a significant amount of time as Soul Coins are usually deeply traumatized by the experience.
<br><br>
When a coin is actually used for some purpose, like fueling a magical device, the soul is torn into horrific agony as its very existence is burned up.
